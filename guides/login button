1. Import the necessary dependencies: In your React component file, import React and the useState hook.

2. Define a functional component for the login form: Create a functional component called LoginForm that will contain the login and password form fields.

3. Declare state variables for login and password: Inside the LoginForm component, use the useState hook to declare state variables for the login and password values. Initialize them with empty strings.

4. Define a function to handle form submission: Create a function called handleSubmit that will be triggered when the form is submitted. It should prevent the default form submission behavior by calling event.preventDefault(). This function will handle the authentication logic and clear the form fields.

5. Create form fields: Within the LoginForm component's return statement, create the input fields for login and password. Bind the value attribute of each field to the respective state variable and use the onChange event to update the state when the user types in the fields.

6. Add a submit button: Include a <button> element within the form to submit the login and password values.

7. Add a click handler to the submit button: Bind the onClick event of the submit button to the handleSubmit function.

8. Add a login button: Add a <button> element outside the form to trigger the login action. Bind the onClick event of the button to a function called handleLogin. This function will set the value of the isLoggedIn state variable to true.

9. Add a logout button: Add a <button> element outside the form to trigger the logout action. Bind the onClick event of the button to a function called handleLogout. This function will set the value of the isLoggedIn state variable to false.

10. Render the LoginForm component: Render the LoginForm component within the App component.
